Following are the licenses of various folders/files of LA931X COMMON HEADER

Folders	                   	   Files	                  License
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
la931x_common_headers                All files	              Dual GPL-2 OR BSD-3 Clause
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Including big blocks of License headers in all files blows up the
source code with mostly redundant information.  An additional problem
is that even the same licenses are referred to by a number of
slightly varying text blocks (full, abbreviated, different
indentation, line wrapping and/or white space, with obsolete address
information, ...) which makes validation and automatic processing a nightmare.

To make this easier, this driver uses a single line reference to Unique License
Identifiers in source files as defined by the Linux Foundation's SPDX project
(https://spdx.org/).

Adding license information in this fashion, rather than adding full license
text, can be more efficient for developers; decreases errors; and improves
automated detection of licenses. The current set of valid, predefined SPDX
identifiers is set forth on the SPDX License List at https://spdx.org/licenses/.

la931x_common_headers uses first line of the file to be SPDX tag.
In case of *#!* scripts, SPDX tag can be placed in 2nd line of the file.

For example, to label a file as subject to the BSD-3-Clause license,
the following text would be used:

SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

To label a file as dual-licensed with "BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0",
the following text would be used:

SPDX-License-Identifier: (BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)

Any new file contributions in this repo shall adhere to the above scheme.
It is also being recommended to replace the existing license text in the code
with SPDX-License-Identifiers.

NOTE: GPLv2 license is applicable when this repo or part of this repo are used
	in context of Linux Kernel developement.
